The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task

resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanctiones the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s lheasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expresscd their opinion in a
measury Minute‚ dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for thc accomplishmcnt ol this important
rational object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
withinareasonable time, and provided proper attentionbe
paid to eoonomy, in making the detailed arrangements,
without unnecessary expense.”

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historioal document should be edited
in such amanncr asto represent with allpossible correct·
ness the text of each writer, derived from acollation of the

best MSS, and that no notes should he added, except
such aa were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the prefacc to each work should
acutam, in addition to the particulars proposed hythe
Master of the Rolls, abiographical account of the author,
so lar as authentia materiale existed for that purpose,
andan estimate of his historical credibility and value.
